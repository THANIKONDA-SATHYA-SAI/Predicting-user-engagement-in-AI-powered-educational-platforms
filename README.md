Engagement metrics include session count, session duration, and completion rate.
Full analysis is in project_report.pdf. 

Methods:
Exploratory data analysis
Multiple linear regression (predicting completion rate)
Logistic regression (predicting high engagement)

Key Findings:
Higher session count and duration increase engagement.
Advanced courses show lower completion rates.
Enrollment is strongly associated with session activity. 

How to Run:
Open the R script containing the analysis.
Install/load required packages (tidyverse, ggplot2, caret).
Run EDA, linear regression,logistic regression, and validation sections.
Review results and compare with the project report.
